            </h1>
            <p class="abc"> Harry Potter and the Philosopher’s Stone" is the first book in the Harry Potter series by
                J.K. Rowling. It follows Harry Potter, a young boy who lives with his unkind relatives, the Dursleys. On
                his 11th birthday, he discovers that he is a wizard and has been accepted to Hogwarts School of
                Witchcraft and Wizardry.

                At Hogwarts, Harry makes close friends like Ron Weasley and Hermione Granger, and learns about magic,
                flying on broomsticks, and the wizarding world. He also learns that his parents were killed by a dark
                wizard named Lord Voldemort, who disappeared after failing to kill Harry as a baby. This event left
                Harry with a lightning-shaped scar and made him famous in the wizarding world.

                As the school year goes on, Harry and his friends discover that someone is trying to steal the
                Philosopher's Stone, a magical object that grants immortality. They suspect their strict professor,
                Snape, but later learn it is actually Professor Quirrell, who is being controlled by the weakened form
                of Voldemort. Harry manages to stop him, and the stone is destroyed to prevent it from falling into the
                wrong hands.

                The book ends with Harry returning home for the summer, excited to return to Hogwarts, where he feels he
                truly belongs.</p>
